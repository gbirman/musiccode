**Programming Assignment 4**

Due Sunday, 11/11 (11:59PM)

Work with your partners!

**1) Create a Max/MSP patch that uses samples you have taken from
recorded sources to create a new piece of music.** All sounds should be
samples - no synthesis allowed! The piece should also make use of some
input control, such as a joystick or the computer keyboard.

Formatting:

-   Use the comment object in Max to document your work.

-   Whenever it makes things cleaner and easier to read, use the
    “patcher” object to encapsulate sub-patches as you would functions
    in ChucK.

-   Use “loadbang” and “loadmess” objects to make sure everything
    initializes the way you want when we try the patch. **TEST** opening
    the patch fresh before submitting it.

WHAT TO TURN IN:

\- your one Max file plus the audio samples together in one zip.

\- Just turn in one copy of the assignment for every pair of students.
Make sure you put both your names at the top of the file in comments.

HOW TO TURN IT IN

A zip file of everything needed to run the Max patch.
