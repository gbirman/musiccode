# Designing-Sound-Max-Patches
All of the practical examples from the book Designing Sound by Andy Farnell, ported to Max 7.

Some examples may have bugs, and many examples look very ugly. Feel free to report any issues or requests to the bug tracker, for a quicker response 
time than whenever I feel like rexamining the patches.
