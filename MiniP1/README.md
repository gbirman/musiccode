**<u>Mini Assignment</u>**

Due **Sunday 10/14 at 11:59pm**

**This assignment is individual.**

Goal: **Create a Max patch that does nothing useful whatsoever**.

You can make a picture visually using the elements, or figure out how to
get the “button” objects to blink and make cool looking Christmas light
patterns, or make some fridge poetry using the different object names.
But it shouldn’t be at all useful, and it shouldn’t make sound.

To prepare for this, download Max 8 from Cycling74.com

Then open Max and select help-&gt;reference from the drop down menu.

Click on Max tutorials on that screen, and **I want you to go through
the first four tutorials from “hello” to “metro and toggle”.**
