**<u>Midterm Assignment</u>**

Due **Tuesday 10/23 at 11:59pm**

Goal: Create an instrument (not a musical composition, but an instrument
that can be played live).

Steps:

-   Create a GUI (graphical user interface) that controls your
    instrument in Max.

-   Create a class in ChucK that implements your instrument.

-   Connect the ChucK class and the Max interface over OSC (open sound
    control), so that your Max GUI allows the user to perform the
    instrument live.

In the folder included with this assignment are some templates to help
get the communication between Max and Chuck working correctly. There is
also a handout that explains receiving OSC in ChucK a little more in
depth.

Make something that sounds cool! I donâ€™t want just sine waves. Also,
think a bit about the interaction with the Max GUI, and try to make it
interesting or creative.
