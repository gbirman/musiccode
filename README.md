# Programming and Music!

These are some songs I created (with various partners' help) while taking *COS 314: Computer and Electronic Music through Programming, Performance, and Composition* at Princeton University. Please install [chuck](http://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/) and take a look at the documentation to get started. Most chuck scripts can be run using the simple command `chuck {name of chuck file}`. Note that song.ck takes an argument that specifies the length of the song. I recommend 120 seconds, which results in the following command: `chuck song.ck:120`. Some assignments might also use [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max), an audio-visual programming language; unfortunately, Max requires a paid subscription to access. Another platform used is [MobMuPlat](http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/doc/index.html), which faciliates the creation audio-visual phone apps.
