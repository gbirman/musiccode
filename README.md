# Programming and Music!

These are some songs I created (with various partners' help) while taking *COS 314: Computer and Electronic Music through Programming, Performance, and Composition* at Princeton University. Please install [chuck](http://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/) and take a look at the documentation to get started. Most chuck scripts can be run using the simple command `chuck {name of chuck file}`. If there's multiple chuck files in a directory `main.ck` is probably the one you're looking for. But you don't necessarily need to chuck the file as a few folders have pre-recorded outputs. Some assignments might also use [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max), an audio-visual programming language; unfortunately, Max requires a paid subscription to access. Another platform used is [MobMuPlat](http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/doc/index.html), which faciliates the creation audio-visual phone apps.
