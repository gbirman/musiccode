# Programming and Music!

These are some songs I created (with various partners' help) while taking *COS 314: Computer and Electronic Music through Programming, Performance, and Composition* at Princeton University. Please install [chuck](http://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/) and take a look at the documentation to get started. Most chuck scripts can be run using the simple command `chuck {name of chuck file}`. Note that song.ck takes an argument that specifies the length of the song. I recommend 120 seconds, which results in the following command: `chuck song.ck:120`.
